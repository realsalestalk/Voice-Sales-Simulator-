Interactive Car Sales Voice Trainer
​Welcome to the interactive sales training simulator for the Lithia Dodge sales team. This tool is designed to help you master the appointment-setting phone script by practicing in a realistic, voice-activated environment before you get on a live call.
​The goal is to build muscle memory so you can handle any customer objection confidently and effectively guide the conversation toward a set appointment.
​✨ Key Features
​🗣️ Real-Time Voice Interaction: Use your microphone to speak the salesperson's lines, just like a real phone call.
​🤖 Instant Feedback: The simulator listens to your response and tells you if you're on the right track or if you need to try the line again.
​📈 Guided Script Flow: Practice handling common customer objections (like asking for price) and learn the exact phrases that lead to a successful outcome.
​👂 Realistic Pacing: The app speaks the customer's lines back to you, helping you get used to the rhythm and flow of a live conversation.
​🚀 How to Use the Simulator
​Using the tool is simple. Just follow these steps:
​Open the Link: Navigate to the live URL for the simulator.
​Allow Microphone Access: The first time you press the red microphone button, your browser (e.g., Google Chrome) will ask for permission to use your microphone. You MUST click "Allow" for the simulator to work.
​Follow the Prompts:
​Listen when the "customer" or "system" is speaking.
​When it's your turn, the prompt at the bottom of the screen will tell you which line to say.
​Press the red microphone button, speak your line clearly, and the app will process your speech.
​Receive Feedback:
​If you say the line correctly, you'll get a "Correct!" message and the conversation will continue.
​If you miss key words, the app will ask you to try the line again.
​Restart Anytime: Click the "Restart" button in the top-right corner to start the simulation over from the beginning.
​🚨 Troubleshooting
​"The microphone button isn't working or I can't hear anything!"
​This is almost always a browser permission issue. Follow this checklist:
​Use Google Chrome: This tool is built using the Web Speech API, which works best and most reliably in Google Chrome on a desktop or laptop.
​Check Microphone Permissions: If you accidentally clicked "Block" when the site asked for microphone access, you can easily fix it.
​Click the padlock icon (🔒) in the address bar to the left of the URL.
​Find the "Microphone" setting in the dropdown.
​Change it from "Block" to "Allow".
​Reload the page.
​Check Your Sound: Make sure your computer's volume is on and turned up so you can hear the customer's lines.
